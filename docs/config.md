# Configuration

All configuration lives under `/etc/tailkitd/`. tailkitd validates every file at startup.

**A missing config file disables the corresponding integration — it returns `503` on every request rather than crashing.** A present but invalid file is a fatal startup error.

Restart tailkitd after editing any config file:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart tailkitd
```

## Directory layout

```
/etc/tailkitd/
  env                          # auth key + runtime env vars (written by install)
  tools/                       # tool registration files (written by tailkit.Install())
  integrations/
    files.toml
    vars.toml
    docker.toml                # only written when Docker is detected at install time
    systemd.toml               # only written when systemd is PID 1 at install time
    metrics.toml
/var/lib/tailkitd/
  recv/                        # default file inbox (one subdirectory per tool)
```

---

## files.toml

Controls which directories tailkitd can read from and write to.

Each `[[path]]` entry grants access to one directory. At least one entry is required.

**Fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `dir` | string | Absolute path, must end with `/` |
| `allow` | list | Permitted operations. Valid values: `read`, `write` |

```toml
# /etc/tailkitd/integrations/files.toml

# Dedicated drop zone for files pushed over the tailnet.
[[path]]
dir   = "/var/lib/tailkitd/recv/"
allow = ["write"]

# Read access to the tailkitd config directory.
[[path]]
dir   = "/etc/tailkitd/"
allow = ["read"]
```

**Validation rules:**
- `dir` must be an absolute path ending with `/`
- `allow` must not be empty
- Duplicate `dir` entries are rejected

### Inbox

Files sent without an explicit destination land in `/var/lib/tailkitd/recv/{tool}/`. No `files.toml` path rule is needed for the inbox — it is daemon-owned. See [api.md](api.md#inbox) for the inbox endpoints.

---

## vars.toml

Controls which project/environment scopes are accessible on this node.

Each `[[scope]]` entry grants access to one project/env combination. At least one entry is required.

**Fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `project` | string | Project identifier. Must match `^[a-z0-9_-]+$` |
| `env` | string | Environment identifier. Must match `^[a-z0-9_-]+$` |
| `allow` | list | Permitted operations. Valid values: `read`, `write` |

```toml
# /etc/tailkitd/integrations/vars.toml

[[scope]]
project = "myapp"
env     = "prod"
allow   = ["read", "write"]
```

**Validation rules:**
- `project` and `env` must match `^[a-z0-9_-]+$`
- `allow` must not be empty
- Duplicate `project`/`env` pairs are rejected

---

## docker.toml

Controls Docker integration. Only written at install time when `/var/run/docker.sock` is present.

Each section maps to a group of Docker endpoints. Setting `enabled = false` on a section returns `403` for all endpoints in that group, regardless of `allow`.

**Valid `allow` values per section:**

| Section | Valid values |
|---|---|
| `[containers]` | `list`, `inspect`, `logs`, `stats`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `remove` |
| `[images]` | `list`, `pull` |
| `[compose]` | `list`, `up`, `down`, `pull`, `restart`, `build` |
| `[swarm]` | `read`, `write` |

```toml
# /etc/tailkitd/integrations/docker.toml

[containers]
enabled = true
allow   = ["list", "inspect", "logs", "stats", "start", "stop", "restart"]

[images]
enabled = true
allow   = ["list"]

[compose]
enabled = true
allow   = ["list", "up", "down", "restart"]

[swarm]
enabled = false
allow   = ["read"]
```

---

## systemd.toml

Controls systemd integration. Only written at install time when systemd is PID 1.

**Units section — valid `allow` values:**

`list`, `inspect`, `unit_file`, `logs`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `reload`, `enable`, `disable`

**Journal section — fields:**

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | bool | — | Gates per-unit journal endpoints |
| `priority` | string | `info` | Minimum log severity. Valid: `emerg`, `alert`, `crit`, `err`, `warning`, `notice`, `info`, `debug` |
| `lines` | int | `100` | Default number of lines returned per request. Must be `> 0` |
| `system_journal` | bool | `false` | Permits `GET /integrations/systemd/journal` (system-wide) |

```toml
# /etc/tailkitd/integrations/systemd.toml

[units]
enabled = true
allow   = ["list", "inspect", "unit_file", "logs", "start", "stop", "restart", "reload"]

[journal]
enabled        = true
priority       = "info"
lines          = 100
system_journal = false
```

---

## metrics.toml

Controls which host metrics are exposed. All sections are independent.

**Shared field:** every section has `enabled = true/false`.

**Section-specific fields:**

| Section | Extra fields |
|---|---|
| `[disk]` | `paths` — list of absolute mount points to report. Empty = all filesystems |
| `[network]` | `interfaces` — list of interface names to report. Empty = all interfaces |
| `[processes]` | `limit` — max processes returned, sorted by CPU desc. Range: 1–100. Default: 20 |

```toml
# /etc/tailkitd/integrations/metrics.toml

[host]
enabled = true

[cpu]
enabled = true

[memory]
enabled = true

[disk]
enabled = true
paths   = []

[network]
enabled    = true
interfaces = []

[processes]
enabled = true
limit   = 20
```

## Permission model

Two layers. Non-overlapping.

**Layer 1 — Tailscale identity** controls who can reach tailkitd at all. Every request is resolved via `lc.WhoIs` — unauthenticated callers get `401`.

**Layer 2 — Integration config files** control what a specific node exposes per operation. Defined per node in `/etc/tailkitd/integrations/`. A node running a production database might allow `containers_read` but not `containers_write`.

**Request validation order on every endpoint:**

1. Is this integration available? (config file present and `enabled = true`)
2. Does the caller have a valid Tailscale identity? (`lc.WhoIs` result)
3. Does this node permit this specific operation? (`allow` list in config)
4. Execute
